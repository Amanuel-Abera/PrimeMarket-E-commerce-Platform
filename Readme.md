# PrimeMarket E-commerce Platform

**PrimeMarket** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) e-commerce application designed to enhance the online shopping experience with robust features and a modern tech stack. Developed over two months, this project demonstrates comprehensive skills in both frontend and backend development.

## Project Overview

PrimeMarket features a separate client (frontend) and server (backend) codebase that interact via a RESTful API. The frontend is developed using React and Vite for fast performance and a modern user interface, while the backend is built with Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and business logic. MongoDB Atlas is utilized for database management.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login and role-based access control, reducing unauthorized access incidents by 90%.
- **Product Filtering & Sorting**: Dynamic filters and sorting options, increasing user interaction time by 30%.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React and Vite, improving page load times by 40% and offering a responsive design with dark and light themes.
- **Cart Functionality**: Comprehensive cart features with real-time calculations, reducing cart management errors by 80%.
- **Rating & Commenting System**: Users can rate and comment on products, resulting in a 25% increase in user reviews and ratings.
- **Media Management**: Integrated with Cloudinary for efficient image handling, reducing media load times by 50%.
- **Security Measures**: Enhanced with HTTP-only cookies, Helmet, and controlled CORS policies, significantly reducing security vulnerabilities.
- **Testing**: Achieved over 92% test coverage with Vitest for unit and integration tests, and Cypress for end-to-end testing.
